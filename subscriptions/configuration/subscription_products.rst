Add subscription products
=========================

In order to be able to suggest and sell your products to your prospects and customers, a
subscription must have its products properly set. As a result, you can create quotations and
continue the sales flow to track the number of subscriptions you sell and manage the revenue they
generate.

Create your first subscription products
=======================================

Go to :menuselection:`Subscriptions â†’ Subscription products`. There, you will have the possibility
to create a new template or edit an existing one. Once named, be careful to select the option
*Can be sold* and deselect *Can be purchased*. For the product type, it is recommended to use
*Service* for subscription products. Indeed, they are non-material products that you provide to
your customers. Finally, you can adapt your price and also add an internal reference.

.. note::
   In the Sales tab, underneath the Subscriptions section, make sure the *Subscription products*
   option is activated. In fact, if you create a subscription product from the **Subscriptions**
   application, this option is selected by default. However, if you create a product from another
   application, it is not the case.
